# Quicksilver Protocol

## Welcome to Quicksilver Protocol
Quicksilver Protocol is an open-source, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built for the Cosmos ecosystem. Our mission is to enable interchain liquid staking—allowing users to stake tokens across any IBC-connected chain while retaining liquidity and participating in on-chain governance.

## What We Do
### Interchain Liquid Staking
Stake your tokens on any supported Cosmos chain and receive liquid staking derivatives, without giving up your keys or control.

### Governance by Proxy
Retain full voting power and influence governance decisions on your origin chain, even while your assets are liquid staked.

### Security and Transparency
All code is open source and subject to community review. We work closely with security researchers and the Cosmos community.
